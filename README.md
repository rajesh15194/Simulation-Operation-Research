# Simulation (Operation-Research)

Simulation is the process of designing a model of a real system and conducting experiments with this model for the purpose of understanding the behaviour of the system and/or evaluating various strategies for the operation of the system.

Here we have implemented simulation of queueing problem.Typically this individual sub-system deals with customers queuing for service. The Carwash example is a simulation of a carwash center with a limited number of machines and a number of cars that arrive at the carwash to get cleaned. This Web App is build using Python With Flask.

Package used- SimPy (It is a process-based discrete-event simulation framework based on standard Python.)
